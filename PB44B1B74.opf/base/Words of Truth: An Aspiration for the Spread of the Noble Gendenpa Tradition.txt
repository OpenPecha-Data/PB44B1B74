This was requested by Rabjampa Lobzang Tenpa, who possesses pure motivation and vast intellect.
Seeing that generally these days the doctrine of Jé Lama is like an exhausted patient
abandoned by the doctor and with no sign of anyone to take charge, I felt it would be right
to contribute in whatever way I could to extending the longevity of these teachings. Thus,
I, the monk Könchok Tenpé Drönmé, wrote this with an aspiring mind.

↑ As Könchok Tenpé Drönmé makes clear in his commentary on this prayer, Mahākāla is the protector
of those following the path for individuals of greater capacity; Vaiśravaṇa is the protector
for those following the path for beings of intermediate capacity; and Kālarūpa/Dharmarāja
is the protector for those following the path for beings of lesser capacity.
